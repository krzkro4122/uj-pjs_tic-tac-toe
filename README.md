# uj-pjs_tic-tac-toe

A simple implementation of the Tic-tac-toe game that just works with all modern bash versions. </br>
Run with `./tic-tac-toe.sh`. Move by picking a field out of numbers from `1` to `9`.
## Features:
- working game mechanics ✅
- autosave ✅
- optional AI ✅

## IMPORTANT NOTE!
To use the full [`SWAG`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swag) potential of this game, pipe it to the [`figlet`](https://linux.die.net/man/6/figlet) command as such:
```
./tic-tac-toe.sh | figlet
```
Then it looks EVEN AS GOOD as this:
